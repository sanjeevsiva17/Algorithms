    # Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.
    # different subsets, we take the union of them

    # union() and find() are naive and the worst case time complexity is linear.
    # The trees created to represent subsets can be skewed and can become like a linked list.
    # The above operations can be optimized to O(Log n) in worst case.
    # The idea is to always attach smaller depth tree under the root of the deeper tree.
    # This technique is called union by rank.
    # When find() is called for an element x, root of the tree is returned.
    # The find() operation traverses up from x to find root.
    # The idea of path compression is to make the found root as parent of x so that we donâ€™t have to traverse all intermediate nodes again.
    # If x is root of a subtree, then path (to root) from all nodes under x also compresses.

# Time Complexity: O(ElogE) or O(ElogV).
# Sorting of edges takes O(ELogE) time.
# Apply find-union algorithm. The find and union operations can take atmost O(LogV) time.
# So overall complexity is O(ELogE + ELogV) time.
# The value of E can be atmost O(V2), so O(LogV) are O(LogE) same
# Therefore, overall time complexity is O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)
